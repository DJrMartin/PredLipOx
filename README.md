Predicting lipid oxidation rate in humans with mid-infrared spectroscopy of blood-based liquid biopsy: proof of concept.

Detection of early stage of metabolic disorders is an urgent clinical challenge. The first stage of metabolic disorders concerns the ability of skeletal muscle to oxidate lipid during fasting sub-maximal and quotidian exercises. Here we propose to use mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to a drop of blood as a non-invasive tool to evaluate this ability. MIR spectroscopy provides a global molecular fingerprint arising from chemical bonds between the CHNOPS atoms that are included in proteins, lipids and carbohydrates molecules. Here we compute a machine learning algorithm with infrared spectra of dried blood droplets from fasting humans as input features to predict lipid oxidation fluxes (in g/min) during submaximal exercise at a steady state (ventilatory threshold 1). In this investigation, the performance of the predictive model using AUROC score for two distinct lipid oxidation rate thresholds (0.18 and 0.4 g/min), yields respective scores of 0.83 and 0.88. Moreover, the discernment of pertinent wavenumbers (spectral biomarqueurs) assumes paramount importance for a comprehensive understanding of the clinical landscape. These findings provide proof of concept and offer future prospects for the personalization of recommendations.
